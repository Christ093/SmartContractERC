# SmartContractERC

`MyToken` is a custom ERC20 token contract built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 implementation. The token includes features for minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, and owner-only access for specific functions.

---

## Features

1. **Minting**: The contract owner can create new tokens and assign them to any address.  
2. **Burning**: Any user can burn their tokens, reducing the overall supply.  
3. **Owner-only functions**: Specific functions, such as minting, are restricted to the contract owner.

---

## Contract Structure

**ERC20**: The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` standard, which provides standard functions like `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `approve`, etc.
---

## Functions

### **Constructor**

```solidity
constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _initialSupply)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `_name`: The name of the token (e.g., "MyToken").
  - `_symbol`: The token's symbol (e.g., "MTK").
  - `_initialSupply`: The initial supply of tokens, minted to the deployer's address.

**Description**: Initializes the token with a name, symbol, and an initial supply. The deployer is set as the contract owner.

---

### **Minting Tokens**

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `to`: The recipient address for the newly minted tokens.
  - `amount`: The number of tokens to mint.
- **Access**: Restricted to the contract owner.

**Description**: Allows the owner to mint tokens and assign them to a specified address. Only the owner can execute this function.

---

### **Burning Tokens**

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount) public
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `amount`: The number of tokens to burn from the sender's balance.
- **Access**: Public—any user can call this function.

**Description**: Allows users to destroy their own tokens, reducing the total supply. Each burn is logged with a `Burn` event.

---

### **Transferring Tokens**

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `to`: The recipient's address.
  - `amount`: The number of tokens to transfer.
- **Access**: Public—accessible to all users.

**Description**: Facilitates the transfer of tokens from one user to another. This function overrides the standard OpenZeppelin `ERC20` `transfer` function.

## Deployment Guide

### **1. Deploy the Contract**

1. Open the contract in **Remix IDE** or any Solidity-compatible development environment.  
2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler (ensure the version is `^0.8.0`).  
3. Deploy the contract to your preferred blockchain network (e.g., Remix VM, testnets, or mainnet).  
4. Provide the required constructor arguments during deployment:
   - `_name`: The token name (e.g., "MyToken").
   - `_symbol`: The token symbol (e.g., "MTK").
   - `_initialSupply`: The initial token supply (e.g., `1000000` for 1,000,000 tokens).

---

### **2. Interact with the Contract**

After deployment, use the following functions:

- **Minting Tokens**:
  - Call `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` to create new tokens (only accessible by the owner).  
  - Example: Mint 1,000 tokens to `0x123...abc`.  

- **Burning Tokens**:
  - Call `burn(uint256 amount)` to destroy tokens from your own balance.  
  - Example: Burn 500 tokens from your account.  

- **Transferring Tokens**:
  - Call `transfer(address to, uint256 amount)` to send tokens to another address.  
  - Example: Transfer 200 tokens to `0x456...def`.  

---

### **3. Owner-Only Functions**

The `mint` function is restricted to the contract owner. If a non-owner tries to execute it, the transaction will revert with an error. Ownership is automatically assigned to the deployer of the contract, but ownership can be transferred if the contract is updated to include a transfer ownership feature.

---

## Summary

`MyToken` is a secure, flexible ERC20 token with minting, burning, and ownership controls. It leverages OpenZeppelin’s implementation for standard ERC20 functionality, ensuring security and compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
